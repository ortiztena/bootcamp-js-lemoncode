## Hotel Reservations

We will simulate a hotel reservation form. To do this, add the following inputs to your HTML:

Room type selector, to choose between Standard, Junior Suite and Suite (< select >)
Checkbox to make use of the SPA or not (< input > checkbox type)
Selector to indicate the room occupation, to choose between Single, Double or Triple (< select >)
Number of nights (< input > type number)
How many nights of parking is desired (< input > type number)
Finally a 'Calculate' button to display the total cost of the room on the screen.
To calculate the cost of the stay, please take into account the following:

The room rate per night is 100 ? for Standard category, 120 ? for Junior Suite and 150 ? for Suite.
The use of the SPA increases the previous rate by 20 ?.
Once you have the rate according to the category and the SPA, the occupation (single or triple) acts as a factor of decrease or increase, being the option of double the standard. That is, single use reduces the rate per night by 25%, while triple use increases it by 25%. 
The double use leaves it as it is.
Each night of parking adds up to 10 euros.
An example of stay would be:

5 nights x Standard room with SPA for individual use + 2 nights of parking In this case the rate per night would be: (100 euros per night + 20 euros spa) at 75% for individual use = 90 euros/night x 5 nights = 450 euros + (10 euros parking x 2 nights) = 470 euros TOTAL.

### OPTIONAL

It dispenses with the calculate button and displays the total result as the user makes changes to the form.
