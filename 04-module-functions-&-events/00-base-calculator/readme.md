## Calculator

Let's create a simple calculator.

As a first step, create 4 functions, one for each of the 4 operations that we are going to implement: addition, subtraction, multiplication and division. The functions should take as input two operands and return the result of applying the operation.

Test the functions simply by playing with them and displaying the result through the console.
Once you have the above, add to the HTML two numerical inputs, which will be the operands A and B, and also 4 buttons, one for each operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division).

The user must fill the 2 inputs with two operands and click one of the buttons. 
The program must show the result of the operation on the screen.

## Optional

If any of the operands are empty, it displays "Error" as a result.
